# Diwali Sales Analysis Using Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental aspect of data science, often taking up a significant portion of a data project. This repository demonstrates various EDA methods and techniques using Python, specifically applied to the Diwali Sales dataset sourced from Kaggle, which is ideal for EDA tasks. The aim is to gain deeper insights into sales data and enhance skills in data science. Good luck with your EDA journey using the Diwali Sales dataset.
This project focuses on understanding customer behavior, identifying trends, and analyzing sales patterns during the Diwali season using sales data. The process involves data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

# 1. Importing Libraries
The libraries used in this project include:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Seaborn: For creating statistical visualizations.
Matplotlib: For building visualizations like bar charts and line graphs.

# 2. Reading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded using the Pandas library, with special encoding applied to handle any non-standard characters in the file. This ensures proper reading of data.

# 3. Dataset Overview
The dataset is reviewed to:

Check its dimensions (number of rows and columns).
Preview the first few rows of data to understand its structure.
Identify missing values and check the data types for all columns.
Get an overall summary of the dataset using metadata like column names and types.

# 4. Data Cleaning
4.1 Dropping Unnecessary Columns
Unwanted columns, such as Status and unnamed1, are removed as they do not contribute to the analysis.

4.2 Handling Missing Values
Any rows with missing values are dropped to ensure clean and reliable data for analysis.

4.3 Data Type Conversion
Columns like Amount, initially stored as strings or floats, are converted to integers to facilitate accurate numerical analysis.

# 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5.1 Gender Analysis
Visualized the distribution of buyers by gender and analyzed their spending.
Insight: Females not only dominate the buyer pool but also exhibit higher purchasing power compared to males.
